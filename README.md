# OZONE-LAYER-DEPLETION-Using Machine Learning to Predict Ozone Layer Depletion (2000–2024)
Ozone layer depletion remains a critical environmental issue with far-reaching consequences for climate, ecosystems, and human health. Between 2000 and 2024, significant efforts have been made to monitor and understand atmospheric ozone trends using satellite data and ground-level air quality measurements. In this context, machine learning—particularly using TensorFlow and Python—offers powerful tools for predicting ozone behavior and revealing underlying patterns.

This project aimed to analyze ozone concentration data from multiple sources, including the U.S. EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) and CAMS (Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service), focusing on the years 2000 to 2024. EPA’s datasets provided daily and hourly ozone levels from regional monitoring stations, while CAMS contributed satellite-based estimates of total column ozone across the globe. These complementary datasets enabled the construction of a well-rounded, feature-rich dataset for time-series forecasting.

The modeling process began with extensive data preprocessing: downloading ZIP archives of ozone data, resampling the readings into daily averages, and interpolating missing values. To capture seasonality and regional variability, data from multiple stations and CAMS indices were merged into a single, time-aligned dataset. Lag features and calendar variables enhanced the temporal awareness of the model.

A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model was implemented using TensorFlow to predict the next day's ozone level based on the past 30 days of data. This architecture was chosen for its strength in handling temporal dependencies in time-series data. The model was trained and validated on an 80/20 split, using scaled features to optimize convergence. Evaluation metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and visual comparison of predicted vs. actual values demonstrated that the LSTM achieved a high degree of predictive accuracy.

Key findings from the analysis showed that ozone levels exhibit seasonal patterns, typically decreasing during colder months. The model also benefited significantly from the inclusion of CAMS data, suggesting that satellite observations enhance ground-level prediction accuracy. The predictive system offers a practical tool not only for environmental researchers but also for public health officials seeking to anticipate ozone exposure risks.

In conclusion, this project illustrates the synergy between environmental science and machine learning. By leveraging TensorFlow for prediction analysis, it becomes possible to better understand ozone dynamics and support informed decision-making. Future improvements may involve integrating more atmospheric variables or expanding to real-time forecasting applications.
Ozone_Analysis_and_Prediction
The emission of ozone-depleting gases impacted the earth’s ozone layer – a layer that absorbs most of the Sun’s ultraviolet radiation. Emissions were increasing rapidly until the 1980s. The primary concern of the ‘ozone hole’ has been its impact on the quantity of UV-B radiation reaching Earth’s surface. When chlorine and bromine atoms come into contact with ozone in the stratosphere, they destroy ozone molecules. One chlorine atom can destroy over 100,000 ozone molecules before it is removed from the stratosphere. Ozone can be destroyed more quickly than it is naturally created. Ozone layer protection from UV-B irradiation is critical to the health of many lifeforms, including human health. Since then the world has achieved rapid progress: the near-elimination of ozone-depleting substances and the trend towards recovery of the ozone layer are arguably among the most successful international environmental collaborations to date. We are analyzing and doing time series forecasting on it To predict we need the detailed data and information of the total ozone present in Dobson Units. To get detailed data we have to extract data from images present from the Website (https://ozonewatch.gsfc.nasa.gov)![model_prediction_plot](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5d4f2e4e-4bfc-4810-9027-3ec0c2ce71e3)!
